# GoEuroTest
This is an exercise I have created for GoEuro company. They use it for evalute code from new hires involved in Java programming and engineering.

I used Spring Boot for this Java old style stand alone application. It was my first try using this feature of Spring and I wanted to try something new.
I haven't used dependency injection yet for this exercise as it is simple enough. I can add it in future versions.

First Draft v1.0.
